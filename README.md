# UoD_ML_Project

This project demonstrates difference between the models with and without the convolutional layers. There are 3 sets of experiments performed in each of which two datasets are used. One with binary classes and other with multiple classes in their dependent variables. 
In one experiment, a sample model is already given.
In 2nd experiment we change the model by adding dense layers but no convolutional layers and see the difference and impact on both the datasets. 
In 3rd experiment we change the model by adding convolutional layers instead of dense layers and using techniques like data augmentation and regularization and see the difference and impact on both the datasets.  

All notebook links are given in the ppt slides (The notebooks have description of all the parameters used and layers chosen).
